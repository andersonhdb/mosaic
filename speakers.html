                      <p>One of Canada's leading Integrative physicians and co-founder of the Westcoast Women's Clinic, Dr. Pawa is also an author and speaker. She has been in practice for over 30 years, initially as a Family Physician with special focus in obstetrics and in Integrative medicine.

Dr. Pawa obtained certification from Harvard Medical School in Mind-Body Medicine and also completed training under the direction of Dr. Deepak Chopra.

Dr. Pawa continues to spread her message and instill techniques for self-care.
